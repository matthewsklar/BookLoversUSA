Based on eibbors/mws-js which was not operational but which was quite
close (although abandoned by its owner about two years ago).

I will try to contact the owner of that abandoned project and work
with him/her to merge our two projects via pull requests.  In the
meantime, I am working on completing functionality and will keep you
posted on that "merge" effort.  I'm hopeful that "eibbors" will be
locatable and happy to execute pull requests from me or to add me as a
contributor.
